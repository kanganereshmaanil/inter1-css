    <p>flex row-Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row ). The items start from the start edge of the main axis. The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink. The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis</p>
    <p>flex column- The flex container's main-axis is the same as the block-axis. The main-start and main-end points are the same as the before and after points of the writing-mode. column-reverse. Behaves the same as column but the main-start and main-end are opposite to the content direction.</p>

    <h2>2.explain inline,internal and external stylesheet</h2>
    <p>Inline- An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>
    <p>Internal- An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</p>
    <p>External- An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>

    <p>Relative positioning: Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.</p>
    <p>Absolute-Absolute positioning defines the position of a given bounding box from the top and left side margins of the web page. This not only allows objects to be placed in an exact location, it also allows objects to be placed one on top of another. </p>

    <p>Z Index (z-index) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.</p>
    <p>Z index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).</p>

    <h2>7.what is differance between pading and margin</h2>
    <p>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.</p>
